This code will give you the solution to any real RUBIK's cube. The solution is not the simpliest solution, but it will 
work. A non-real RUBIK's cube will likely result in an infinite  loop. It follows the basic RUBIK's cube solving 
instructions that can be found here: https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube-beginners-method/. 
A great tool for testing the code and seeing visually how the output should be read can be found here: 
https://rubikscu.be/. A note: the code is bulky, and not the most efficient. It can take a few minutes to run, depending
on the input cube.
